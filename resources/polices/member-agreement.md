# Welcome to Hackspace Manchester!
## This is a brief primer on how the space works
Please read and complete this induction. You will not be able to access the space until this is complete   

## Introduction

Hackspace Manchester is something we do together. It is a community. The infrastructure (building, equipment, tools, electric, internet etc) provides the foundations, and people working together with shared understandings and expectations are what provide a place of strong community.    

Every member is a citizen of the Hackspace Community and as such must follow the rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the community can exist safely and cohesively.

## House Rules
Usually things work well, and this is in part due to our rules. 
They can be read at any time at [here](https://hacman.org.uk/rules).

## Member Handbook
To keep things simple and provide an overview of how the space works, we have a member handbook which you can flick through. 

[There is a copy online](https://list.hacman.org.uk/uploads/short-url/sytcpF9wevLdlb8VjpruXOhvrlD.pdf) and there are two copies in the space for reference:
* One is by the lightswitches as you come in
* The other is on the member noticeboard.

*** Please take a moment to flick through the member handbook so you're grounded in how the space operates ***

## RFID Access
When you fill in your payment information, you'll be posted a fob and a welcome flyer. The fob grants you 24/7 access to the space.
This flyer will have the ID of the enclosed fob written on it, usually something like:
`ABCDEF12` or `AB12CD34`. The fob ID will be made up of numbers `0-9`, and letters `A-F`. 

You'll need to enter this ID into the membership system in order to link the fob to your account. This is easy - when it arrives:
* Click "Your Membership" in the left hand menu
* Click "Edit" in the top right
* Enter your key fob ID in the "Key Fob" section 
* Click save.

*** Please note: your Fob Will Not Work Until you have completed this induction and ticked the box at the bottom ***

## Equipment Inductions

* the laser cutter

* lathes (wood, metal)

## Members Storage

To help improve members storage the system supports the ability to claim your box (shelf/cube in our case) each cube/shelf of members storage in the space now has a laser cut number on it. This number refers to the ID number in the members storage system

**If you are currently violating member storage rules by having more than one cube or 1/2 a shelf please ensure you rectify this as you might otherwise find your stuff is moved so members without spaces can claim a space**
