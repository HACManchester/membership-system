<b>Telegram Group Chat</b><br>

<a href="https://t.me/hacmanchester">t.me/hacmanchester</a><br></br>
<b>In-person Events</b><br>
We have various meetings throughout the year - you'll find these announced on the forum and telegram. The three main ones are:<br>
<b>Hack-the-Space Day</b> - a day where we come together to improve the space and eat pizza.<br>
<b>Members Meetings</b> - Usually a weekday evening to discuss some of the important topics going on in the forum.<br>
<b>AGM</b> - Usually around September each year. Overview of our finances, progress over the past year and voting in new board members.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Equipment use</h2>
<p>Certain equipment requires an induction so you don't hurt yourself or damage the machines for example: the Laser Cutter, 3D printers, sewing machines, lathes, etc. Please check signage around the machine. A good general rule to go by is that if it's particularly dangerous or complex, it's probably induction protected.<br></br>

The Tools & Equipment (<a href="https://members.hacman.org.uk/equipment">members.hacman.org.uk/equipment)</a> page on the Members Portal also notes which pieces of equipment require inductions.</p>
<p><strong>Inductions are run by volunteer trainers, and may not be available immediately,</strong> sometimes it may take a couple of months to arrange. You can signup for an induction via the equipment pages on the Members Portal.<br></br>

Look out for any instructions in the ‚ÄúInduction Next Steps‚Äù section on equipment pages. Some teams ask for you to contact them either via telegram or the forum to arrange a suitable date/time for training, whereas others have regular training slots each week.
</p>
<b>We're always on the hunt for more members to run training sessions, if you're interested please let the team know.</b>
<p>You're welcome to get going with all our other tools immediately. Please note, tools and equipment should not be borrowed to be taken out of the space.</p>
<h3>What if something breaks or I get injured?</h3>
<p>Hackspace gets a heck of a lot of use, even if it seems quiet when you visit. <strong>Things do break, and that's ok!</strong> We have the budget to fix/replace things, the most important thing is to let us know.<br></br>
There's QR codes all around the space for reporting broken things via a <a href="https://forms.gle/CqLzjv4svNqDARwW8">Google Form.</a> Unless there's a sign on something saying it's broken, it's likely no one has reported it. Please put a sign on the equipment you've reported.

The same goes for reporting injuries and near misses. First aid kits are located by the entrance.
</p>
<h3>What if something runs out?</h3>
<p>We keep a small supply of regularly used things in the space for members to use on a fair-use basis. (the full list is here: <a href="https://docs.hacman.org.uk/Operations/Consumables/">docs.hacman.org.uk/Operations/Consumables/</a>), if you think something is low on stock or has run out:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Ask the community if we have any of the item either in person or online.</li>
    <li>Still no joy finding it? check it's on the consumables list and that general members can purchase it, then either buy some and <a href="https://forms.gle/QdBMwtkExtk8JZuU9">expense the space</a>, or report it via the <a href="https://forms.gle/CqLzjv4svNqDARwW8">report form.</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
    
<h3>The space should buy an X/Y/Z</h3>
<p>We are often looking at what new tools and equipment we can replace/buy. If you have a good idea, speak to one of the teams around the space and they can explain how our purchasing process works and how you can lead the setup of a new tool.</p>



<h2>How can I help out around the space?</h2>
<p>The space has zero staff. Everything is done by members and we encourage everyone to help out how they can. We have teams that run each area, and lots of smaller ongoing projects that are always looking for people to take them on. Head to the forum if you'd like to get involved with these, or email <a href="mailto:info@hacman.org.uk">info@hacman.org.uk</a> and we can put you in touch with the teams you‚Äôre interested in.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask the community on Telegram or the forum. If you have any membership issues you can contact the board via <a href="mailto:board@hacman.org.uk">board@hacman.org.uk</a> </p>

Thanks for reading all that, and we look forward to seeing you soon!
