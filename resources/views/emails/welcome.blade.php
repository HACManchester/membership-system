<h2>üëã Chat with us</h2>
We have two main channels of communication online, our forum and Telegram.
<h4>Our forum</h4>

<a href="https://list.hacman.org.uk/">https://list.hacman.org.uk</a></p>
<h4>Telegram group chat</h4>

<a href="https://t.me/hacmanchester">https://t.me/hacmanchester</a></p>
<h4>Member Meetings</h4>
<p>We have various meetings called as and when needed by members - but the most regular is the Members Meeting, called every month to two months, usually the first Monday of the month at 19:30. You'll find announcements of this <a href="https://list.hacman.org.uk/c/announcements/23">in the announcements section of the forum</a></p>
<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Equipment use</h2>
<p>Certain equipment requires an induction so you don't hurt yourself or damage the machines for example: the Laser Cutter, 3D printers, sewing machines, lathes, and any equipment in the workshop with a "This is Bloody Dangerous" tag. Our volunteer inductors organise these to fit around their schedules, some are ad-hoc and some are at set times and dates. If you'd like to use one of these machines, ask on telegram or the forum and someone will point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>You can signup for an induction for most of the items via the Members Portal at <a href="https://members.hacman.org.uk">https://members.hacman.org.uk</a> once you have done this you just need to contact the relevant team either via the helpdesk, telegram or email to arrange a suitable date/time. <strong>Please Note that inductions are done by volunteers in their free time so please be patient</strong>.</p>
<h2>Consumables</h2>
<p>We keep a small supply of regularly used things in the space (the full list is here: http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Consumables), if you cant find something do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>ask someone in the space if they know where it is - if the answer is "we've run out" GOTO 3</li>
<li>ask on telegram (https://hacman.org.uk/telegram)</li>
<li>still no joy finding it? Contact the procurement team via the helpdesk at <a href="https://help.hacman.org.uk">https://help.hacman.org.uk</a> or if you need it urgently (and it's on the list) go buy some then email the receipt to procurement@hacman.org.uk</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask the community on Telegram or the forum.</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>
